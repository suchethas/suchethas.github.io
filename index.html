<p>Hi, I’m Suchetha.  I’m an Artificial Intelligence researcher at <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence">JP Morgan AI Research Lab</a> in New York where I work on a number of research problems and applications of AI in Finance.  Areas that I’ve worked on include classification and regression, clustering, natural language processing, deep learning, adversarial attacks and defense.  I am also interested in researching about impacts of AI on society and international relations.</p>

<p>I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore">Mysore</a> which is a city in the southwestern part of India and I moved to New York about 8 years ago to earn a master's in Computer Science from NYU.  I currently live in Brooklyn.  I am a trained classical dancer.  I am trained in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatanatyam">Bharatnatyam</a> which is a major Indian classical dance form.  I’ve learnt and practiced it for over a decade. </p> 

<p> Here's a fun fact about my name: My surname is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic">patronym!</a> </p>

<p> I like to think of myself as an avid reader — don’t believe me? My friend and I run a book club! If you’re curious about what we’ve been reading, you can check out our list <a href="https://jsbookclub.my.canva.site/">here</a>. </p>
